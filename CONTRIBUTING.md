## Getting Started

To get started with contributing to the project, follow these steps:

1. Fork the project repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
3. Set up the project on your local machine by following the project's setup instructions provided in the README file.
4. Create a new branch for your contribution. It is recommended to use a descriptive branch name that summarizes your changes.
5. Make your changes and test them thoroughly.
6. Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message.
7. Push your changes to your forked repository.
8. Submit a pull request to the main project repository.

## Development Workflow

To maintain a consistent and high-quality codebase, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- Before starting to work on a new feature or bug fix, create a new branch from the latest state of the `main` branch.
- Keep your branches focused on a single task or issue.
- Write clear and concise commit messages that describe the purpose of your changes.
- Make sure your code follows the project's [style guide](#style-guide).
- Update or add relevant unit tests for the changes you make.
- Run the existing test suite and ensure that all tests pass.
- Keep your branch up to date with the latest changes from the `main` branch by regularly pulling the latest changes into your branch.
- Avoid pushing directly to the `main` branch. All changes should go through a pull request.

## Style Guide

Please follow the project's style guide when writing code. The style guide ensures consistency throughout the project's codebase. The key points of the style guide include:

- Use consistent indentation (e.g., spaces or tabs) throughout the codebase.
- Follow the naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes.
- Write clear and concise comments to improve code readability.
- Avoid unnecessary code duplication and follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
- Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Format the code according to the language-specific standards (e.g., PEP8 for Python).

## Submitting a Pull Request

To submit your changes for review, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that your branch is up to date with the latest changes from the `main` branch.
2. Commit and push your changes to your forked repository.
3. Go to the main project repository on GitHub and

 open a new pull request.
4. Provide a clear and descriptive title for your pull request.
5. In the pull request description, explain the purpose and scope of your changes.
6. If your pull request addresses any existing issues, reference them using the issue number (e.g., "Fixes #123").
7. Wait for the project maintainers to review your changes and provide any feedback or suggestions.
8. Make any necessary changes based on the feedback received.
9. Once your changes are approved, they will be merged into the main project repository.
